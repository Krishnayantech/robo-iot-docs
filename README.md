# AI-Powered Cybersecurity in IoT: Protecting Smart Devices from Modern Threats

## **Introduction**
The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized industries by connecting billions of devices worldwide. However, with increased connectivity comes heightened security risks. IoT devices are highly susceptible to cyberattacks such as malware, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and unauthorized access. Traditional security measures struggle to keep pace with evolving threats, making **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** an essential tool in cybersecurity.

## **1. Whitepaper: AI in IoT Security**
### **Key Threats & AI Solutions**
- **Weak Credentials & Unauthorized Access** → AI enforces strong authentication and access controls.
- **Malware & Ransomware** → AI-powered detection systems scan for anomalies and block malicious activities.
- **DDoS Attacks** → AI identifies and mitigates botnet-driven traffic before it causes damage.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks** → AI encrypts communication channels and detects interception attempts.

### **Best Practices for AI Security in IoT**
- Use **AI-driven firewalls** for real-time threat monitoring.
- Ensure **IoT devices receive frequent security updates**.
- Implement **strong encryption** for all communications.
- Utilize **AI-based anomaly detection** to prevent zero-day attacks.
