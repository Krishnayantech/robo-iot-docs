Autonomous IoT-Powered Wildlife Monitoring Robot

Overview

The Autonomous IoT-Powered Wildlife Monitoring Robot is a smart robotic system designed for wildlife conservation and research. Equipped with AI-driven animal detection, IoT sensors, and autonomous navigation, this robot can track, monitor, and collect real-time environmental data on wildlife activity. It provides valuable insights for researchers while minimizing human intervention in sensitive ecosystems.

Key Features

AI-Powered Object Detection: Identifies and classifies animals using a pre-trained deep-learning model.

IoT Connectivity: Sends real-time data to a cloud dashboard for researchers.

Autonomous Navigation: Uses GPS, LiDAR, and ROS (Robot Operating System) for obstacle avoidance and waypoint tracking.

Solar-Powered System: Ensures prolonged operation in remote areas.

Remote Data Access: Wildlife activity logs are accessible via a web dashboard or mobile app.

1. AI-Based Animal Detection

The robot uses OpenCV and TensorFlow to detect and classify animals using a camera.

Code: AI-Based Animal Detection (Python & OpenCV)

import cv2
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Load pre-trained AI model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model("animal_detector.h5")
labels = ["Elephant", "Deer", "Tiger", "Zebra", "Unknown"]

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Open camera feed
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    resized_frame = cv2.resize(frame, (224, 224)) / 255.0
    prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(resized_frame, axis=0))
    label = labels[np.argmax(prediction)]

    cv2.putText(frame, f"Detected: {label}", (10, 50), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 255, 0), 2)
    cv2.imshow("Wildlife Detection", frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

2. IoT Sensor Data Collection & Cloud Upload

IoT sensors collect real-time environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and GPS location.

Code: IoT Data Collection & Cloud Upload (ESP32 - Arduino)

#include <WiFi.h>
#include <HTTPClient.h>

const char* ssid = "Your_WiFi";
const char* password = "Your_Password";
const char* serverURL = "http://your-cloud-dashboard.com/upload";

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) delay(500);
}

void loop() {
  int temperature = random(20, 35); // Simulating temperature readings
  int humidity = random(30, 70);

  HTTPClient http;
  http.begin(serverURL);
  http.addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");

  String payload = "{\"temperature\": " + String(temperature) + ", \"humidity\": " + String(humidity) + "}";
  int responseCode = http.POST(payload);

  Serial.println(responseCode > 0 ? "Data sent!" : "Failed to send data.");
  http.end();

  delay(5000);
}

3. Autonomous Navigation with GPS & LiDAR

The robot uses GPS for positioning and LiDAR for obstacle avoidance, controlled by ROS.

Code: Autonomous Navigation (Python & ROS)

import rospy
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist

rospy.init_node("wildlife_robot")
pub = rospy.Publisher("/cmd_vel", Twist, queue_size=10)
rate = rospy.Rate(10)

move_cmd = Twist()
move_cmd.linear.x = 0.5  # Move forward
move_cmd.angular.z = 0.1  # Adjust direction

while not rospy.is_shutdown():
    pub.publish(move_cmd)
    rate.sleep()

4. Cloud Dashboard for Real-Time Data Visualization

The IoT data collected from the robot can be visualized using ThingsBoard, Firebase, or a custom-built dashboard.

Features of the Dashboard:

Live camera feed of detected animals

Temperature & humidity logs

GPS location tracking of the robot

Alerts for unusual animal activity

Hardware Requirements

Microcontroller: ESP32 / Raspberry Pi 4

Camera Module: Raspberry Pi Camera / USB Camera
